# Industrial_IoT_Sensor_System-simple-
This project simulates a factory's digital transformation using IoT sensors and a statistical analysis DLL. By identifying bottlenecks with low availability or long cycle times, the system applies Industrial Engineering Line Balancing techniques. It recommends machine adjustments to optimize utilization rates and balance Takt time effectively.
